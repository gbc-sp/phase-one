# Project Phase 1

## Setup

At present, to streamline the startup process for students, the [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) libraries are attached directly to the HTML page using `<script>` tags. Likewise, components are attached in the same way, as individual JS files, rather than using `export` and `import` (Babel transpiles to `require`).

The suggested code editor for this project is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). To run the application, install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension and follow the instructions for starting a live server (`right-click` > `Open with Live Server` should do it).
